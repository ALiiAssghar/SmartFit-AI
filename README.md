# SmartFit-AI is an innovative fitness web application designed to provide personalized exercise recommendations based on user inputs such as name, email, age, and fitness goals. It offers a user-friendly interface with options for different fitness levels—Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced—and categorizes exercises into Strength, Cardio, and Flexibility. Additionally, the app calculates safe health ranges for blood pressure and sugar levels tailored to the user’s age group. The backend, built using Flask, handles user data securely, while the frontend, styled with a vibrant red and pink theme, ensures an engaging experience. SmartFit AI includes features like user registration, logout functionality, and secure data storage. This project demonstrates the integration of machine learning concepts with web technologies, making fitness accessible and personalized for everyone.
